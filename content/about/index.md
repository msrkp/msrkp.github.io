This is Mohan Sri Rama Krishna Pedhapati. 

About me?

#### on a biological and cultural level:
A homo sapien from southern part of India, speaking a Dravidian language.

#### on a ontological level:
I don’t know what I am; perhaps I am an evolving work, a piece of art that will only reach completion after I am gone, continually shaped by books, philosophy, and science. An art without purpose or meaning, yet the art becomes the purpose itself.

#### on a professional level:
Mohan Sri Rama Krishna Pedhapati holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and is a Senior Application Security Auditor at Cure53. He specializes in Browser and Web Security, with a particular focus on Client-Side Security, and has made significant contributions to the field through his research and vulnerability discoveries.
