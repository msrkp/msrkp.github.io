### π o clock?

Inspired by Karpathy's tweet, I started taking a picture every day at 3:14—Pi O'Clock. I have a terrible memory, and the moment I saw that post, I knew I had to try it. I’ve always thought of memory as a kind of key-value linked list, if you lose the key, it’s almost impossible to retrieve the memory. But by taking a picture every day, I figured it could serve as a key database. Seeing those photos might help me retrieve specific memories. Though I do think the brain's memory is limited, only the most significant events from that day are likely weighted more heavily and stored by the hippocampus.

Anyway, I've noticed that most of the photos I took at Pi O'Clock aren't particularly great, which makes sense since I wasn't planning the shots. I'll be including additional photos from the same day to help the story make more sense.

### day 1 - 16 Dec 2024

### day 2 - 17 Dec 2024  

at the auckland airport, stopped by the customs officer.<br>
combed every corner of my bag and myself.<br>
an ounce of foreign soil on my hiking shoes; not allowed.<br>
the brits ruined the flora and fauna, won't allow it again.<br>

### day 3 - 18 Dec 2024 


at the auckland art gallery<br>
portrait rarely face squarely<br>
this one does, and now I know why<br>
the gaze is intimidating.<br>

while the flowers melt my heart, <br>
yearning to be plucked to propogate, <br>
yet, its a mere art, <br>
impriosned for my pleasure <br>

<div class="image-row">

        <figcaption> π - 1:14  </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

weary through the day,<br>
restlessness longing for rest.<br>
walk to a park, sit beneath the tree,<br>
look around at birds, animals, and humans<br>
let peace find me.<br>
............ but wait, the damn notification,<br>
Dragging me back to the mess I never chose <br>
